# Vehicle_Actuated_control
In this project, Traffic camera imagery and deep learning are used to construct a Vehicle Actuated Control (VAC) system.  The system automatically regulates traffic signals, delivering green signals to the lanes with the most traffic after analysing real-time vehicle density from photos.
